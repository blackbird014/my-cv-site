\subsection{Personal Profile}\label{personal-profile}

I possess a robust interdisciplinary background encompassing physics,
finance, and risk management, complemented by extensive experience in
information technology, particularly within the financial sector. My
professional tenure includes a partnership role as a software developer
and architect at Innoveo AG, a Zurich-based software firm, where I
contributed for approximately seven years. Additionally, I am a
certified professional risk manager, equipped with in-depth expertise in
asset management, derivatives, financial markets, and comprehensive risk
management frameworks.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I have pursued advanced
studies in big data, data engineering, and blockchain technology through
a combination of university courses, accredited online training, and
independent research. I hold a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) in
Finance, during which I focused on blockchain-based decentralized
finance (DeFi), specifically examining lending protocols, flash loans,
and DeFi primitives. Furthermore, I operate an Ethereum node to
facilitate personal research in this domain. To enhance my research and
development processes, I leverage artificial intelligence tools,
employing an iterative methodology to systematically structure and
refine my approach, define deliverables, and assess the quality of the
final outcomes. Demonstrations of these achievements are available for
review.

\subsection{Selected Achievements}\label{selected-achievements}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As \textbf{personal projects} utilizing AI.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Developed a tool for monitoring the Ethereum blockchain, extracting
    data on lending protocols.
  \item
    Established a comprehensive company infrastructure, either locally
    or in the cloud, to facilitate a complete software lifecycle from
    development to CI/CD, showcasing the capability to simulate and
    deliver various combinations.
  \item
    Created multiple Proofs of Concept (PoCs), including a connection
    between Injective chain indexers and an agent that integrates data
    with calls to Allora's decentralized AI, generating reports on
    potential arbitrage opportunities. Developed as generic code to
    connect to any blockchain and integrate any AI model.
  \item
    Constructed a toy blockchain as a Cosmos zone, capable of managing
    Proof of Stake (PoS) and serving foundational building blocks for
    decentralized finance (DeFi), including decentralized exchanges
    (DeXs) and lending protocols.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  At \textbf{Innoveo Solution AG}, I contributed to the development of a
  proprietary product as a partner from its inception. This involved:
